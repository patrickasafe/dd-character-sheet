* I think it's important to place all the stats on the same page. Maybe after, we can export an this data to a compact UI.
* Import: classes, abilities, equipments and everything else from API D&D5 using a dropdown menu or textfield with autocomplete.
* Custom Colors, Images, and themes for roles
* Night-mode
